# [NosWings IS BACK](https://noswings.com)


ON.NosWings is our old OpenNos fork to get NosWings server running.
This project regroups all the data we made to run our server (shops, raids, Nostale static datas, useful sql scripts...)


### Follow our new project : [ChickenAPI](https://github.com/BlowaXD/ChickenAPI)

### Who are we 

We are a bunch of enthusiast who decided to make their own fork of OpenNos, modifying a lot of things designed for our needs.

### Why don't we maintain OpenNos ?

As we've already told numerous time, OpenNos has proven its capacity and its limitation.

We are in 2018, our needs are not the same as at the beginning of OpenNos, that's why we decide to use more recent technologies and a more mature software architecture.

## Do not forget !

Please, do not forget to mention that you are using someone's work. /!\
